# Numerical-Optimization
The goal of this repository is to contain the concepts I learned in numerical optimization. 

### 1. Steepest descent

### 2. Newton descent

### 3. Strong Wolfe Conditions

### 4. Trust Region Methods

### 5. Conjugate Gradient

### 6. BFGS

### Project: ROF Dual minimization of Total Variation Denoising

### Extension: Finite Differencing + Auto differentiation, nonlinear least squares and more
